In the fifth part, I have written a program to implement Multilayer Neural Network for Binary classification model of Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Prognostic). In this dataset we have Number of instances:198 and Number of attributes: 34 (ID, outcome, 32 real-valued input features).

## Bayesian Inference Model

Here, I have apply the conjugate Bayesian Inference model assuming the Olympic Track & Field Events dataset to be Gaussian to predict the future value.

## K Nearnest Neighbours

Here, I have written the code to implement the KNN algorithm for the diabetes dataset. The datasets consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

# Support Vector Machines

Here, I have written the code to implement the SVM algorithm for the IRIS dataset. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.
