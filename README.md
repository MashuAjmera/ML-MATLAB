# ML-MATLAB

This is a repository of various machine learning algorithms written in MATLAB ([Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_ekAD7U-wU)).

## Decision Tree

Here, I have constructed decision tree from the dataset for the diabetes dataset. The datasets consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

In the fifth part, I have written a program to implement Multilayer Neural Network for Binary classification model of Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Prognostic). In this dataset we have Number of instances:198 and Number of attributes: 34 (ID, outcome, 32 real-valued input features).

In the sixth part, I have written a program to implement Multilayer Neural Network for Multiclass classification problem of Iris dataset with the attributes( Id, SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm and the three classes:( Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour
and Iris Virginica).

## Bayesian Inference Model

Here, I have applied the conjugate Bayesian Inference model library assuming the Olympic Track & Field Events dataset to be Gaussian to predict the future value.

## K Nearnest Neighbours

Here, I have written the code to implement the KNN algorithm for the diabetes dataset. The datasets consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. Independent variables include the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

- [Predict whether the patient is diabetic](https://github.com/MashuAjmera/ML_MATLAB/knn.m) | [Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPVLWh4iX0Q)

## Support Vector Machines

Here, I have written the code to implement the SVM algorithm for the IRIS dataset. The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.
